# Movie-Recommender
ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommender System using Streamlit &amp; TMDb API

This project is a content-based movie recommender system built with Python and Streamlit. It suggests 5 similar movies based on user selection, using precomputed cosine similarity scores. The system fetches movie posters dynamically via the TMDb API for a visually rich recommendation experience.
# Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, TMDb API

Features:
1. User-friendly web interface (Streamlit)
2. Real-time poster fetching from TMDb
3. Content-based recommendations (cosine similarity)
4. Pickle-based model loading for fast runtime

âœ… Ideal for anyone looking to understand how to build a basic recommendation engine with real-world data and deployment interface.
